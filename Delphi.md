# Delphi evaluation
Note down with 3 things that work well in this semester and three which are malfunctioning. Then pass on to your neighbor.

When you receive a form from another, you mark with a line next to the statements you agree with.

And then pass it on to your neighbor.

When you get your own sheet back, you hand it over to Kasper.


<table border = "1" width = "100%" ID = "Table2">
<tr>
<th width = "70%"> Name three things that work well </td> </th>
<th> Mark with (one!) line if you agree </td> </th>
</Tr>
<Tr> <td> <br><br> </td> <td> </td> </tr>
<Tr> <td> <br><br> </td> <td> </td> </tr>
<Tr> <td> <br><br> </td> <td> </td> </tr>
</Table>
